# 🌟 Advanced Features of Maya Data Utility Engine  

Unlock the full potential of data anonymization with our **Advanced Features** designed to streamline your workflow and enhance the utility of your anonymized data. Below are key functionalities you can utilize for more efficient data handling.

---

## 🔍 Derive Data Types  

The **Derive Data Types** functionality is a powerful tool within the Maya Data Utility Engine. It automatically detects and categorizes the data types present in your uploaded files, saving you time and ensuring accuracy in your anonymization process.  

### How to Use It:  
1. **Upload your file** to the platform.
2. Click the **‘Derive Data Types’** button (as shown in the image below).  
3. The system will analyze the data and display the detected types for each field.

💡 **Benefit**: This feature simplifies the setup process, allowing you to focus on the actual anonymization rather than manually identifying data types.

## 📂 File Group  

**File Groups** are essential for maintaining relationships among anonymized files. When saving your anonymization job, you can select a file group from the dropdown menu (illustrated in the image below). 

### Key Points to Remember:  
- **Default Group**: Files anonymized using the **‘Default’** file group will not retain any relationships.
- **Trial Version**: In the free/trial version, only two groups are available for relationship preservation: **Group – 1** and **Group – 2**. 

### Example of Relationship Preservation:  
- If the name **John** in **file_1.csv** is anonymized to **Smith_1** using **Group – 1**, then **John** in **file_2.csv** will also be anonymized to **Smith_1** if the same utility parameters and group are applied.

🔗 **Benefit**: This ensures consistency across related files, making data analysis more coherent and meaningful.

## 💾 Save Utility Sets  

The **Save Utility Sets** feature allows you to preserve your chosen settings for Data Types, Utility Parameters, and Privacy Relevance. This means you won’t have to reset these preferences every time you upload a new file for anonymization.

### How to Save a Utility Set:  
1. **Upload your file** and select the desired **Data Types**, **Utility Parameters**, and **Privacy Relevance**.
2. Click the **‘Save as’** button. 
3. A pop-up window will appear prompting you to fill in:
   - **Business Area**  
   - **Industry Area**  
   - **Name** (mandatory field for saving the utility set)

### Important Notes:  
- **Business Area** and **Industry Area** represent industry verticals and horizontals, respectively.
- The **Name** is the only mandatory field required to save your utility set.

4. After completing the form, click the **‘Submit’** button.  
5. Upon successful submission, you’ll see a confirmation message on the screen.

✨ **Benefit**: This feature allows you to streamline your anonymization process, ensuring consistent settings for future file uploads.
