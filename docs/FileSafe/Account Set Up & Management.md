## 📋 Step 1: How to Register?  

Creating your account is the first step to unlocking everything the platform has to offer. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Fill out the registration form** with all required details. Every field is mandatory, so take your time to ensure all information is correct—especially your email address. This will be used for logging in and password resets, so double-check its accuracy.
   
2. **Password Requirements**:  
   Your password needs to meet the following criteria to ensure the security of your account:
   - At least **8 characters** in length
   - Includes both **uppercase** and **lowercase letters**
   - Contains **at least one number** and **one special character** (like `!`, `@`, `#`, etc.)

3. **Review Terms & Privacy Policies**:  
   Before you finalize your registration, carefully read through the [Terms of Use](#) and [Privacy Policy](#). These outline your rights and responsibilities on the platform. If you agree to the terms, click the **‘Sign up’** button. **By clicking**, you confirm your agreement and initiate the registration process.

4. After registering, you’ll be automatically redirected to the **Login** page, ready for your first sign-in!

## 🔑 Step 2: How to Login?  

Now that you're registered, logging in is a breeze. Here’s how:

1. Go to the **Login page** and enter your registered email and password.
   
2. **Prove You’re Human**:  
   For security purposes, you’ll be asked to complete a **reCAPTCHA** to verify you're not a robot.

3. Click the **‘Sign in’** button. If your details are correct, you'll be taken directly to your personal **Dashboard**, where you can explore all the platform features.
