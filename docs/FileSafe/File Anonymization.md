# 🔒 Comprehensive Guide to File Anonymization  

Welcome to your step-by-step guide on how to securely anonymize sensitive data using our platform. This process ensures that your data remains private while maintaining its utility. Follow the instructions below to upload, process, and save your anonymized files with ease.

## 📤 Step 1: Upload Your File

The first step in the anonymization process is uploading your data file. You can upload either an **.xlsx** or **.csv** file from your device by clicking the **‘Choose a file’** button. Here's what to do:

1. **Click** the **‘Choose a file’** button.
2. **Select** the file you want to anonymize from your device.
3. For a quick test, you can use one of our **sample files** to explore the process.

📝 **Important**: The first row of your spreadsheet will be treated as the **header** and used as field names in subsequent steps. Double-check your headers to ensure they’re labeled correctly.

## 🛠️ Step 2: Select Data Types & Utility Parameters  

After uploading your file, it’s time to configure the **data types** and **utility parameters** for each field name. This is a critical step to ensure the proper anonymization of your data. Follow these steps:

1. **Review** each field name derived from the header of your file.
2. **Assign** the appropriate data type (e.g., text, number, date) to each field.
3. **Select** the utility parameters, which determine how the data will be anonymized. Utility parameters may include options such as:
   - **Data masking** for sensitive text fields.
   - **Generalization** for numerical ranges.
   - **Suppression** for fields that must be entirely hidden.

🔧 **Pro Tip**: Choose utility parameters carefully, as they affect the level of privacy and usability of the anonymized data.

## 💾 Step 3: Save the Anonymized File  

Once you've configured all data types and utility parameters, it's time to save the anonymized version of your file. Here’s how:

1. **Select** the **file group**, **utility set**, and confirm the parameters for anonymization.
2. Click the **‘Execute’** button. A pop-up window will appear, prompting you to name your anonymized file.
3. **Enter the desired file name** for easy identification in your history.
4. Click the **‘Submit’** button to start the anonymization process.

🚀 **What Happens Next?**  
After submission, you’ll be redirected to the **History page**, where you can view the job status and track progress in real-time.

## 🔄 Step 4: Monitor Job Status  

To check the progress of your anonymization job, simply navigate to the **History page** and:

1. Use the **‘Refresh’ button** located in the top-right corner of the page.
2. The status of the job (e.g., **‘In Progress’**, **‘Completed’**) will be updated on this page.
   
🕵️‍♂️ **Need updates in real time?** The refresh button helps you stay on top of the process and know when your file is ready for download.
